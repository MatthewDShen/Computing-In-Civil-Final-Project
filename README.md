# The following project is used to determine the expected demand for the NYU shuttle system

## Created by Matthew Shen
This project takes survey data from NYU students, staff, and faculty. It then uses this data to generate a multi-nomial logit model and determines the probability of a given user selecting to use the NYU shuttle bus. This project is specifically looking at users of the NYU Shuttle route A. Route A runs from NYU's Downtown Brooklyn Campus to the Washington Square Park campus.
